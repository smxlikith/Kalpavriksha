# User Management System (CRUD)

User records are stored in a text file (`users.txt`) in CSV format.

## Features

- **Create**: Add a new user (ID, Name, Age).
- **Read**: Display all stored users.
- **Update**: Modify details of a user based on their ID.
- **Delete**: Remove a user record by ID.
- Data is persisted in `users.txt`.

## Usage

```bash
gcc Assignment-2/userCRUD.c -o userCRUD
```

./userCRUD
```
