# Interprocess Communication & Socket Programming — Assignment

## Project Overview

This repository contains two parts:

- Part 1 — Implementations of common Interprocess Communication (IPC) mechanisms in C.
- Part 2 — A TCP socket based multithreaded ATM simulation (server + client) demonstrating concurrent client handling, file-backed account storage and synchronization.

Goals: strengthen understanding of IPC techniques, multithreading (pthreads), file handling and client–server communication.

## Repository layout (suggested)

- IPC/ — subfolder containing Part 1 IPC programs and a README with per-program details
- ATM/ — subfolder containing Part 2 ATM server/client, account.txt and a README with usage
